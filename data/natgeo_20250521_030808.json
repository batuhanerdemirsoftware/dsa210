An old, rotted-out woodpecker nest is a perfect place. From their new home, they begin searching for nectar and pollen to feed themselves and their brood. Photo 1: The swarm moves into an old black woodpecker nest cavity (viewed from inside to outside). Photo 2: A construction bee uses its mandibles to take wax scales from a nestmate. Photo 3: About two weeks after the bees move in, the first combs become visible.\n\nHoneybees are important pollinators, helping a large variety of plants reproduce and improving harvests., Fruit and vegetable plants in particular depend on honeybee pollination. Some pesticides used in agriculture can be highly toxic to honeybees. Neurotoxins from the neonicotinoid group are particularly devastating. Theys disrupt the bees' sense of orientation and memory and weaken their immune systems. As a result, bees can no longer find their way back to their hive and become vulnerable to disease. #WorldBeeDay\n\nThe pictures are part of my story, \"The Secrets of Bees,\" published in the March 2020 issue of National Geographic magazine.

With a few well-placed sticks and a lot of determination, these ecosystem engineers reshape entire landscapes. Their dams slow water, green the land, and help protect habitats from wildfire.\n \nIn Idaho and California, land managers and tribal partners are following the beavers' blueprint, constructing \"beaver dam analogs\" that mimic their work.

To my left are acacia trees.  Mountains rise on all sides, and above the suspended dust the sky is deep, unfiltered blue.\n\nBut this is not Africa. This is Saudi Arabia, specifically Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve, a protected area spanning more than 9,000 square miles (24,500 km2). And it‚Äôs not zebras that slowly come into focus before me, but Persian onagers, the oldest divergence of the genus Equus (horse). Dating back some 4 million years, the Persian onager is older than the horse and the zebra. Onagers' migrations were once even more extensive than those of Arctic caribou, or of wildebeest in the Serengeti.\n\nHistorically revered in Arabia‚Äôs literature and culture, they were celebrated as a symbol of untamed freedom and resilience and were used to invoke wilderness and the strength and self-reliance that were needed to survive in it. These qualities were admired by the nomadic people with whom they shared a vast and harsh desert terrain. They stood as reminders of the humility such severe environments demanded. However, Persian onagers are now considered endangered, with fewer than 600 remaining in the wild and just a few small groups of introduced animals in Mongolia, Israel, and Jordan.\n\nThe reintroduction of onagers to this landscape after more than a hundred years of absence recalls a time when the Syrian wild ass occurred throughout Saudi Arabia's deserts. This marks the first wild population in Saudi Arabia since the early 1900s and a key moment in an ambitious vision to rewild the kingdom‚Äôs protected areas.\n\nAs their numbers and ranges increase, onagers will assume their ecological roles such as browsing, grazing, and seed dispersal, and become part of the natural predator-prey dynamics.
