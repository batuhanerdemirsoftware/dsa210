She’s preparing to release her first single, marking a transition from her career as Aubrey, the “Modern Family” actress, to Frances Anderson, the singer-songwriter. 🎤🌼 \n\n“When it comes to writing music, and just creativity in general, vulnerability is your strength,” says Aubrey, who believes that open expression and a willingness to take risks are her most valuable tools as a budding musician. “Lean into that. We don’t want to steer away from it. Start anywhere.” \n\nTo celebrate Prom 2025, join Aubrey as she scavenges for the vintage prom dress of her dreams at @hiddentreasurestopanga (spoiler alert: it’s mom and TV dad @jessetyler approved), and stay for an exclusive sneak peek of her debut song, “Telephones and Traffic,” which is out May 23. 👗\n\nMusic by @aubreyandersonemmons",

It’s always been my passion,” says @theweeknd (Abel Tesfaye) ahead of the release of his new film, “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” which hits theaters May 16.\n\nBefore heading to the film’s premiere in New York, Abel discusses his latest artistic endeavor and the connections he’s made through creativity along the way. \n\n“Making music is more of a solo journey. With a film, you have to find a group of people who can connect with this material, with the script — and they become like family,” he says. “It belongs to them as much as it belongs to you. So that’s kind of been my mantra: work with people who genuinely want to work with you and genuinely believe in the project.”\n\nMusic by @theweeknd",
