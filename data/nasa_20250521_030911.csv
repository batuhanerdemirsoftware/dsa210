This mesmerizing view of concentric light circles is a star trail: a photograph that shows stars‚Äô apparent motion over time in the night sky. NASA astronaut Don Pettit made this composite image combining 18 30-second-long exposures (that is, he left the camera shutter open for half a minute for each photo) taken while aboard the @ISS in 2012.‚Å£
‚Å£
The space station travels at a speed of five miles per second (8 km per s), orbiting Earth about every 90 minutes. In 24 hours, the crew aboard see 16 sunrises and sunsets. The orbital lab‚Äôs unique viewpoint and speed make it perfect for observations of Earth, allowing astronauts to take photos of our home planet, its atmosphere, and natural disasters.‚Å£

Actually, the Lunar Roving Vehicle was 10 feet (3.0 m) long and 7.5 feet (2.3 m) wide ‚Äî roughly the size of a small car ‚Äî but in this photo, it's dwarfed by Plum Crater, which is nearly 130 feet (40 m) in diameter. 

Apollo 16 astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke drove the lunar rover to Plum Crater on April 21, 1972, to collect samples; this photo of Duke was taken by Young, the mission commander. ""Big Muley,"" a 26-pound (11.7-kg) rock collected by Young and Duke on the rim of Plum Crater, was the largest single sample brought back from the Moon during the entire Apollo program.

@NASAWebb treated us to a sweet perspective: Herbig-Haro 49/50‚Äîa towering swirl from a nearby protostar‚Äîis (coincidentally) topped with a multi-hued spiral galaxy.‚Å£
‚Å£
Herbig-Haro objects are outflows produced by jets launched from a nearby, forming star. The outflows, which can extend for light-years, plow into a denser region of material. This creates shock waves, heating the material to higher temperatures. The material then cools by emitting light at visible and infrared wavelengths.‚Å£
‚Å£
The galaxy that appears, by chance, at the tip of this cosmic soft-serve is a much more distant, face-on spiral galaxy. It has a prominent central bulge represented in blue, filled with older stars. The bulge also shows hints of ‚Äúside lobes,‚Äù suggesting that this could be a barred spiral galaxy. Reddish clumps within the spiral arms show the locations of warm dust and groups of forming stars.‚Å£
‚Å£
Image description: This cosmic image is dominated with billowing clouds of orange-red gas, rich in detail. At the tip of the cloud, a spiral galaxy is visible, with a concentrated blue center that fades outwards to blend in with red spiral arms.

Saturn and its innermost rings look like a close-up of a record in this image taken by Cassini, a sophisticated robotic spacecraft sent to study Saturn and its complex system of rings and moons in unprecedented detail. For more than a decade, Cassini shared the wonders of Saturn, its spectacular rings, and its family of icy moons.‚Å£
‚Å£
Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. They are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are as large as mountains.‚Å£

Our friends at the @EuropeanSpaceAgency recently shared a dazzling young star cluster as astronomers have never seen it before.‚Äâ
 ‚Äâ
This star cluster, NGC 346, is located in the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way about 200,000 light-years away. Though @NASAHubble has studied this cluster before, this image is the first to combine Hubble‚Äôs observations made at infrared, optical, and ultraviolet wavelengths, giving an intricate view into the star-forming factory. ‚Äâ
‚Äâ
NGC 346 is home to more than 2,500 newborn stars. The cluster‚Äôs most massive stars, which are many times more massive than our Sun, blaze with intense blue light in this image. Researchers used two sets of observations taken 11 years apart to trace the motions of NGC 346‚Äôs stars, revealing them to be spiraling in toward the center of the cluster. This spiraling motion arises from a stream of gas from outside of the cluster that fuels star formation in the center of the turbulent cloud.‚Äâ

The station‚Äôs orbital path takes it over 90 percent of the Earth‚Äôs population, with astronauts taking millions of images of the planet below. Check out more facts about the space station:

- The International Space Station is larger than a six-bedroom house, with six sleeping quarters, two bathrooms, a gym, and a 360-degree-view window called the cupola.
- The space station has been continuously occupied since November 2000.
- Peggy Whitson holds the record among American astronauts for the most time spent in space, at 675 days.
- The station travels a distance equivalent to the Moon and back in about a day.

The Tarantula Nebula, located in a neighboring galaxy about 160,000 light-years from Earth, is full of bright clouds of gas and dark clumps of dust. This nebula is one of the most productive star-forming regions in the nearby universe‚Äîand even though its individual dust grains are incredibly tiny, far smaller than the width of a single human hair, gravity brings them together in disks around these stars to form larger clumps. 

Eventually, these clumps can form planets and solar systems, clearing out the space around them. 

This image of the Tarantula Nebula was captured by our orbiting @NASAHubble telescope.

On May 13, 1992‚Äî33 years ago today‚Äîastronauts Richard J. Hieb, Thomas D. Akers and Pierre J. Thuot stepped outside of space shuttle Endeavour on the first (and so far, only) three-person spacewalk. The trio spent eight-and-a-half hours maneuvering the Intelsat VI satellite seen here into the shuttle's cargo bay, where a new motor was installed to help it reach its final orbit.

STS-49, the mission on which this spacewalk took place, was Endeavour's inaugural flight into space. Endeavour flew 25 missions, spending 299 days and over 120 million miles (190 million km) in low Earth orbit, before touching down at @NASAKennedy for the last time in 2011. Nine years later, Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, the first astronauts to visit the @ISS in SpaceX's Crew Dragon, named their spacecraft ""Endeavour"" in honor of the first shuttle they ever flew on.

The amazing dancing lights we can see close to the North and South Poles of Earth happen on other planets, too, and @NASAWebb captured new details of auroras on the biggest planet in our solar system. Observations show that auroras on Jupiter are huge in size and are also hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on Earth.
 
On Earth, auroras are caused by solar storms. When charged particles rain down on the upper atmosphere, it excites gases and causes them to glow colors of red, green, and purple. On Jupiter, there's an additional source of auroras ‚Äî the magnetic field of the gas giant grabs charged particles from its surroundings, including its tumultuous volcanic moon, Io.

Io‚Äôs estimated 400 volcanoes spew particles that escape the moon‚Äôs gravity and orbit Jupiter. During a solar storm, a barrage of charged particles is unleashed onto the planet. Jupiter‚Äôs large and powerful magnetic field captures charged particles and accelerates them to tremendous speeds. These speedy particles slam into the planet‚Äôs atmosphere at high energies, which excites the gas and causes it to glow.
 
Now, Webb‚Äôs unique capabilities are providing new insights into the auroras on Jupiter. The telescope‚Äôs sensitivity allows astronomers to increase the shutter speed to capture the quick changes of auroral features.

The Carina Nebula complex is one of the most energetic star-forming areas in our galaxy ‚Äî within it lies the Keyhole Nebula, pictured here by the European Southern Observatory. Our Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) was able to detect the magnetic field streamlines shown over this image.
 
Eta Carinae, a huge active star neighboring the Keyhole Nebula, could have influenced the nebula's shape with its strong winds. Data from SOFIA's observations show that the magnetic fields in the loop seem affected by the star's strong wing. The magnetic field spreads out in a fan shape, matching the wind from Eta Carinae. This shows that the magnetic field is being disturbed by the star's energy.
 
The magnetic field in the loop is much weaker than the star's wind, which means that while magnetic fields are important in the early stages of star formation, they don‚Äôt do much to stop the cloud from being broken apart by the energy from massive stars. Scientists now wonder if the same is true in other places where big stars are forming.

In a nebula filled with newborn stars, 7,500 light-years from Earth, lies the Mystic Mountain: a massive pillar of gas and dust. The three-light-year-tall Mystic Mountain gets its name from its towering, craggy landscape, which resembles a mountain to the naked eye. However, @NASAHubble's near-infrared vision is able to peer through the gas and dust, keeping a ghostly outline while allowing astronomers to see the stars within.

Hubble captured this image of the Mystic Mountain in 2010 as it celebrated 20 years in orbit. More recently, the Carina Nebula (the home of the Mystic Mountain) was the subject of one of the first full-color science images ever captured by @NASAWebb.
