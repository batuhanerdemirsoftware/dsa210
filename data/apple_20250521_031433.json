In celebration of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, photographer Phelim H. artistically explores the complex emotions and sensations of living with Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n“After I was diagnosed with MS, a new identity began to form within me. I had to get to know this “new me,” while still carrying the version of myself from before. Exploring my emotions through my work helped with that process and gave me a way to connect with people dealing with similar things.” #ShotoniPhone16Pro by Phelim H. @phelimhoey\n\nMusic: “All My Friends (Pink Skies Remix)” by @blushhmusic_ @pinkskiesmusic\n\n--\n\nAlt Text: A video going through a collection of photos. The sculptures pictured feature hand casts and support items such as canes, along with lines and a black and white color scheme. The first photo is of a two finger cast with colorful wires coming out of it. Their shadow and the shadow of someone’s hand are behind it. The next photo is of a black walker with white balls attached on an all black background. We then see an empty arm cast mold on an art table. The next photo is a side shot of a person from the waist down with white bars are on their legs and a cane. Then, a sculpture made of canes with white bar reflectors creating two upward facing arches. The next collection of photos are of an art piece on a black set taken at different points. It’s made up of three structures that look like the inside corner of a cube. Looping waves of drawn light are in each of the structures. Then we see someone touching black clay strips with white lines in a box held by another person, followed by black strips wrapped around a hand on a black grid surface. The next photo is of casted hands broken up in pieces as the light from a window shines through blinds, followed by another photo of clay casted hands. The final photo is a behind the scenes shot of the featured art pieces.",
