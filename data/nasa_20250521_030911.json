Observations show that auroras on Jupiter are huge in size and are also hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on Earth.\n \nOn Earth, auroras are caused by solar storms. When charged particles rain down on the upper atmosphere, it excites gases and causes them to glow colors of red, green, and purple. On Jupiter, there's an additional source of auroras ‚Äî the magnetic field of the gas giant grabs charged particles from its surroundings, including its tumultuous volcanic moon, Io.\n\nIo‚Äôs estimated 400 volcanoes spew particles that escape the moon‚Äôs gravity and orbit Jupiter. During a solar storm, a barrage of charged particles is unleashed onto the planet. Jupiter‚Äôs large and powerful magnetic field captures charged particles and accelerates them to tremendous speeds. These speedy particles slam into the planet‚Äôs atmosphere at high energies, which excites the gas and causes it to glow.\n \nNow, Webb‚Äôs unique capabilities are providing new insights into the auroras on Jupiter. The telescope‚Äôs sensitivity allows astronomers to increase the shutter speed to capture the quick changes of auroral features.\n \nVisual descriptions:\n\n1.

This shows that the magnetic field is being disturbed by the star's energy.\n \nThe magnetic field in the loop is much weaker than the star's wind, which means that while magnetic fields are important in the early stages of star formation, they don‚Äôt do much to stop the cloud from being broken apart by the energy from massive stars.
