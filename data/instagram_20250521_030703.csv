She’s preparing to release her first single, marking a transition from her career as Aubrey, the “Modern Family” actress, to Frances Anderson, the singer-songwriter. 🎤🌼 

“When it comes to writing music, and just creativity in general, vulnerability is your strength,” says Aubrey, who believes that open expression and a willingness to take risks are her most valuable tools as a budding musician. “Lean into that. We don’t want to steer away from it. Start anywhere.” 

To celebrate Prom 2025, join Aubrey as she scavenges for the vintage prom dress of her dreams at @hiddentreasurestopanga (spoiler alert: it’s mom and TV dad @jessetyler approved), and stay for an exclusive sneak peek of her debut song, “Telephones and Traffic,” which is out May 23. 👗

It’s always been my passion,” says @theweeknd (Abel Tesfaye) ahead of the release of his new film, “Hurry Up Tomorrow,” which hits theaters May 16.

Before heading to the film’s premiere in New York, Abel discusses his latest artistic endeavor and the connections he’s made through creativity along the way. 

“Making music is more of a solo journey. With a film, you have to find a group of people who can connect with this material, with the script — and they become like family,” he says. “It belongs to them as much as it belongs to you. So that’s kind of been my mantra: work with people who genuinely want to work with you and genuinely believe in the project.”

@jeanicejperez (Jeanice Perez) and @jordyn_lenae (Jordyn Lenae) are more than mother-daughter besties — they’re a duo whose bond was built on love, trust and mutual respect. 

“My mom has taught me to be unapologetically myself. Watching her show up with confidence and kindness, no matter the space, has made me feel like I can take up space too,” says Jordyn. “If Jordyn were a color she’d be yellow — she lights up any space she walks into,” says Jeanice. 💛✨💛

To celebrate Mother’s Day, the pair put together a skit highlighting Jordyn taking on some mom duties for the day, while Jeanice gets to enjoy the luxuries of being… a teenager. 

“I don’t say it enough, but I do notice every little thing you do for me. I see how hard you work, and I appreciate everything you do,” says Jordyn to her mom. “Watching you grow up has been the greatest joy of my life,” says Jeanice. “Being your mom is my proudest title.” ​​💕

Mumbai-based professional dancer @prem_mondal_2202 (Prem Mondal) moves, flips and twists where the music takes him. “I just forget everything when I dance,” says Prem. “I feel a happiness in me and I love it every single time.”

Inspired by her love of watching cooking videos, Berlin-based creator @jaclynsth (Jaclyn) started her own “After School as a Fashion Student” cooking series, where she shows how to make simple and fun meals incorporating Chinese recipes.  “Eating out is expensive, so I basically had no choice but to cook all my meals myself. Through that, I discovered my love for food — both eating and cooking it. Other food content creators inspire me a lot. I have an entire recipe folder saved on Instagram and frequently look for inspo on what to cook there.”
