# Instagram User Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Instagram user behaviors, focusing specifically on content posting patterns, hashtag usage, and user interactions. Insights derived from this analysis can significantly enhance social media marketing strategies, content optimization, and engagement growth efforts.

## Research Questions
The primary objectives of this analysis include:

* Which types of posts (photos, videos, reels, or stories) receive the most user engagement?
* Which hashtags are most effective in driving user engagement?
* How does the timing of posts influence the level of engagement?
* Is there a significant correlation between follower count and engagement levels?
* Does caption length affect likes and comments received?

## Data Collection Sources
Data will be collected through web scraping using Python (Selenium, BeautifulSoup).
Alternatively, publicly available datasets from platforms such as Kaggle may be utilized.

## Dataset Description
The collected dataset will include the following variables:
## Instagram Post Dataset

| Attribute      | Description                                      | Type           |

| Post ID      | Unique identifier for each post               | Numeric       |
| User ID      | Unique user identifier                        | Numeric       |
| Username     | Instagram username                           | String        |
| Followers    | Number of followers of the user              | Numeric       |
| Following    | Number of accounts the user is following     | Numeric       |
| Post Type    | Type of the post (photo, video, reel, story) | Categorical   |
| Post Timestamp | Date and time when the post was published  | Timestamp     |
| Likes        | Number of likes the post received            | Numeric       |
| Comments     | Number of comments on the post               | Numeric       |
| Caption      | Text description of the post                 | String        |
| Hashtags     | List of hashtags used in the post           | List of strings |


## Data Collection Plan
The data collection phase will primarily involve:

1. Instagram Web Scraping
- Tools: Python (`Selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`)
- Target: Profiles of selected influencers or posts under specific hashtags/categories.

2. Alternative Method:
- Third-party APIs (e.g., Instagram Graph API via Meta, RapidAPI).

3.Tools & Libraries:
- `selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `requests`

## Analytical Methods
The project will consist of the following analytical components:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data distribution analysis, identifying missing and outlier values
- Visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)

2. Hashtag Analysis
- Frequency analysis and effectiveness measurement
- Trend analysis of top hashtags over time

3. User Engagement Analysis
- Comparison of engagement by content type
- Time series analysis to determine peak engagement times (day/hour analysis)

4. Textual Analysis (Caption Analysis)
- Sentiment analysis (optional)
- Relationship between caption length and user interaction (likes, comments)

## Expected Results and Visualizations
The analysis will produce the following outputs:

- Lists and visual representations of most effective hashtags
- Charts illustrating engagement levels by content type (bar graphs, pie charts)
- Heatmaps depicting optimal posting times
- Regression and scatter plots demonstrating relationships between follower count and engagement metrics


## Applications of Results
- Enhanced social media marketing strategies
- Content optimization for brands, influencers, and marketers
- Improved user interaction predictions for social media analytics tools
